Since the development of the code, some of the LINCS resources using during the analysis have been deprecated, so code included in `signatures_using_lm_limma_Phenformin.R` isn't working anymore. Thus, the original signature obtained  `Phenformin_Limma_model_level3.gmt` is also included in the repository. 

Follow the instructions in `Phenformin_Analysis_mainCode_htejer2016.R` to reproduce the analysis.
